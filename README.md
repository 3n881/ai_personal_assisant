# AI Personal Assistant with MCP Client

This project implements an AI-powered personal assistant that interacts with users via a chat interface. The assistant connects to multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, processes queries using Anthropic AI, and maintains a history of conversations similar to ChatGPT. It also provides a web interface where users can seamlessly interact with the AI assistant.

## Features
- **Chat Interface**: A clean and user-friendly chat interface for interacting with the AI assistant.
- **Chat History**: Ability to view previous messages in the conversation.
- **Multiple MCP Server Connectivity**: The MCP client connects to multiple servers for redundancy and load balancing.
- **AI Integration**: Uses Anthropic AI for generating responses based on user input.
- **Session Management**: Each conversation is tied to a unique session for context retention.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive chat UI that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Anthropic AI (for generating AI responses)
  - MCP Client (for handling multiple server communication)
